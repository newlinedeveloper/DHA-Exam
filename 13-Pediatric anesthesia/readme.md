## **Pediatric Anesthesia â€“ Short & Important Notes**  

Pediatric anesthesia presents unique challenges due to anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological differences compared to adults. Below are the key concepts to focus on.  

---

### **1. Airway Differences in Pediatrics**
- **Large head & occiput** â†’ Flexed neck, need a shoulder roll for neutral positioning.  
- **Large tongue** â†’ Can obstruct the airway easily.  
- **Narrowest part of the airway**  
  - Infants: **Cricoid cartilage** (funnel-shaped airway).  
  - After age 10: **Glottis level (vocal cords)** (similar to adults).  
- **Obligate nasal breathers** (until ~6 months).  
- **High larynx (C3-C4)** compared to adults (C4-C5).  

**Implications**:  
- Prefer **uncuffed ETT in children <8 years** (to prevent subglottic injury).  
- Use **straight blades (Miller) in neonates & infants** (better epiglottis control).  

---

### **2. Respiratory System**
- **Higher oxygen consumption (6-8 mL/kg/min) than adults (3-4 mL/kg/min).**  
- **Lower functional residual capacity (FRC)** â†’ Faster desaturation during apnea.  
- **More compliant chest wall but stiff lungs** â†’ Risk of airway collapse.  
- **Higher respiratory rate** but **lower tidal volume (5-7 mL/kg).**  
- **Immature respiratory control** â†’ Prone to apnea, especially in preterm neonates.  

**Implications**:  
- **Pre-oxygenation is critical** to prevent rapid desaturation.  
- **Controlled ventilation may be required** due to weak respiratory drive.  

---

### **3. Cardiovascular System**
- **Cardiac output is heart rate-dependent** (limited ability to increase stroke volume).  
- **Parasympathetic dominance** â†’ Prone to **bradycardia** (vagal responses common).  
- **Lower blood pressure (BP)** due to immature vasomotor tone.  
- **Fetal circulation transition** â†’ Risk of **persistent fetal circulation** in neonates with hypoxia.  

**Implications**:  
- **Atropine premedication** can prevent bradycardia (e.g., during intubation).  
- **Hypoxia, acidosis, and hypothermia can cause cardiovascular collapse**.  

---

### **4. Thermoregulation**
- **High surface area-to-body weight ratio** â†’ Rapid heat loss.  
- **Non-shivering thermogenesis (brown fat metabolism)** is the primary heat source in neonates.  
- **Hypothermia increases oxygen consumption** â†’ Can lead to **acidosis and apnea**.  

**Implications**:  
- **Use warm fluids, forced air warmers, and warmed OR** to maintain normothermia.  

---

### **5. Fluid & Electrolyte Management**
- **Higher total body water (TBW)** (~75-80% in neonates vs. ~60% in adults).  
- **Immature kidneys** â†’ Poor handling of sodium and glucose.  
- **Higher metabolic rate** â†’ Increased fluid requirements.  

**Fluid Guidelines:**  
- **Maintenance Fluids**: **4-2-1 Rule**  
  - 4 mL/kg/hr (for first 10 kg)  
  - 2 mL/kg/hr (for next 10 kg)  
  - 1 mL/kg/hr (for each additional kg)  
- **Common Fluids Used**:  
  - **Neonates**: Dextrose-containing fluids (D5 1/4 NS).  
  - **Older children**: Balanced crystalloids (e.g., Lactated Ringerâ€™s).  

---

### **6. Anesthetic Drug Considerations**
- **MAC (Minimum Alveolar Concentration) is higher** in infants (due to increased metabolic rate).  
- **Faster inhalational induction** due to high alveolar ventilation/FRC ratio.  
- **Prolonged drug clearance in neonates** due to immature liver enzymes.  
- **Increased sensitivity to opioids** (risk of respiratory depression).  

**Commonly Used Drugs:**  
- **Inhalational Agents**:  
  - **Sevoflurane** (preferred due to minimal airway irritation).  
  - **Avoid Desflurane/Isoflurane** (airway irritants).  
- **Induction Agents:**  
  - **Propofol** (rapid onset, but caution in neonates due to hypotension).  
  - **Ketamine** (useful for hemodynamic instability).  
- **Muscle Relaxants:**  
  - **Succinylcholine (SCh) is avoided** (risk of hyperkalemia, malignant hyperthermia).  
  - **Rocuronium is preferred** for neuromuscular blockade.  

---

### **7. Pediatric Pain Management**
- **Immature pain pathways, but neonates feel pain!**  
- **Acetaminophen (Paracetamol)** is commonly used for mild to moderate pain.  
- **Regional anesthesia (caudal, epidural) is effective for post-op analgesia.**  

**Opioid Considerations:**  
- **Morphine clearance is slow in neonates** â†’ Risk of apnea.  
- **Fentanyl is preferred for short procedures** (less histamine release).  

---

### **8. Regional Anesthesia in Pediatrics**
- **Caudal epidural is commonly used** for lower abdominal/lower limb surgeries.  
- **Landmarks for caudal block** â†’ Sacral hiatus.  
- **Dose for caudal block**:  
  - **0.5-1 mL/kg of 0.2% Ropivacaine** (max dose 2.5 mg/kg).  
- **Peripheral nerve blocks (e.g., brachial plexus block) are useful for upper limb surgery.**  

---

### **9. Special Considerations for Premature & Neonates**
- **High risk for post-anesthetic apnea** (especially if <60 weeks post-conceptional age).  
- **Need postoperative monitoring** for apnea and bradycardia.  
- **Use of caffeine or aminophylline** may help reduce apnea risk.  

**Key Point:**  
- **Neonates & preemies are at high risk for respiratory complications post-op.**  

---

### **10. Emergency Situations**
- **Laryngospasm** (common in children during induction/emergence).  
  - **Treatment**: Positive pressure ventilation, deepening anesthesia, and succinylcholine if severe.  
- **Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)**  
  - Triggered by volatile anesthetics & succinylcholine.  
  - **Treatment:** Stop triggers, give **Dantrolene**, cool patient, and manage acidosis.  
- **Airway Obstruction**  
  - Most common cause: **Tongue fall-back in deep sedation**.  
  - Use **jaw thrust or oral airway** for relief.  

---

## **Key Takeaways**
- **Airway:** Small, easily collapsible, cricoid is the narrowest point.  
- **Respiration:** High oxygen demand, low FRC â†’ Rapid desaturation.  
- **Circulation:** HR-dependent cardiac output, bradycardia risk.  
- **Thermoregulation:** Prone to hypothermia â†’ Warm perioperative environment needed.  
- **Pharmacology:** Higher MAC, faster inhalation induction, delayed hepatic metabolism.  
- **Pain Management:** Caudal blocks, fentanyl preferred over morphine.  
- **Emergency Care:** Risk of apnea, laryngospasm, and MH â†’ Preparedness is key.
