### **Short and Important Notes on Obstetric Anesthesia**  

#### **1. Physiological Changes in Pregnancy Relevant to Anesthesia**  
- **Respiratory System:**  
  - Increased oxygen consumption (+20–30%).  
  - Decreased functional residual capacity (FRC) → Rapid desaturation under apnea.  
  - Increased minute ventilation (progesterone effect).  
- **Cardiovascular System:**  
  - Increased cardiac output (+30–50%) → Higher risk of heart failure in compromised patients.  
  - Aortocaval compression (supine hypotension) → Prevented by left lateral tilt position.  
- **Gastrointestinal System:**  
  - Delayed gastric emptying → Higher aspiration risk (Mendelson’s syndrome).  
  - Always consider **rapid sequence induction (RSI)** with cricoid pressure in emergency situations.  
- **Hematologic System:**  
  - Hypercoagulability → Increased risk of DVT/PE.  
  - Physiologic anemia of pregnancy due to plasma volume expansion.

#### **2. Pain Pathways in Labor & Analgesia Options**  
- **Stages of Labor & Pain Transmission:**  
  - **First stage (dilation of cervix & uterus):** Visceral pain via T10-L1.  
  - **Second stage (fetal descent & delivery):** Somatic pain via S2-S4 (pudendal nerve).  
- **Labor Analgesia Options:**  
  - **Epidural analgesia** (gold standard) → Blocks both first & second-stage labor pain.  
  - **Spinal analgesia** (for C-section or severe pain).  
  - **Opioids (Fentanyl, Remifentanil PCA)** → Short-term option for labor analgesia.  

---

#### **3. Neuraxial Anesthesia in Obstetrics (Spinal, Epidural, CSE)**  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Less neonatal depression compared to general anesthesia.  
  - Better maternal hemodynamic stability.  
- **Commonly Used Techniques:**  
  - **Spinal Anesthesia** → Used for C-sections; fast onset but short duration.  
  - **Epidural Anesthesia** → Used for labor analgesia; slow onset but longer duration.  
  - **Combined Spinal-Epidural (CSE)** → Immediate pain relief + long duration.  

✅ **Dosing for C-section spinal anesthesia:**  
- **Bupivacaine 10–12.5 mg** + **Fentanyl 10–25 mcg** + **Morphine 0.1–0.2 mg (for post-op analgesia).**  

---

#### **4. Complications of Neuraxial Anesthesia in Obstetrics**  
- **Hypotension (most common)**  
  - Due to sympathetic blockade → Preload with IV fluids & treat with ephedrine/phenylephrine.  
- **High Spinal/Total Spinal Anesthesia**  
  - Severe hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory distress → Manage with **vasopressors, airway support**.  
- **Post-Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH)**  
  - Occurs due to CSF leak → Treated with **caffeine, fluids, epidural blood patch**.  
- **Accidental Intravascular Injection**  
  - If **epidural test dose** is positive → Stop injection, provide supportive care.  

---

#### **5. Anesthesia for Cesarean Section**  
- **Preferred:** **Spinal anesthesia** (unless contraindicated).  
- **Indications for General Anesthesia:**  
  - Maternal refusal of neuraxial anesthesia.  
  - Coagulopathy or infection at the site of needle insertion.  
  - Emergency situation where neuraxial anesthesia is not feasible.  
- **Key Considerations:**  
  - **Rapid sequence induction (RSI)** with **propofol + suxamethonium**.  
  - Use **cricoid pressure** to prevent aspiration.  
  - **ETT (Endotracheal Tube) size:** 6.5–7.0 mm due to airway edema in pregnancy.  

---

#### **6. Obstetric Emergencies & Anesthesia Considerations**  
- **Preeclampsia/Eclampsia:**  
  - Avoid high-dose **vasodilators** (BP should not drop drastically).  
  - **Magnesium sulfate** is the drug of choice for seizure prevention.  
  - **Neuraxial anesthesia preferred**, unless severe coagulopathy.  
- **Placenta Previa:**  
  - Increased bleeding risk → Prepare for **massive transfusion**.  
- **Placental Abruption:**  
  - Coagulopathy risk → Consider general anesthesia if urgent delivery is needed.  
- **Uterine Atony & Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH):**  
  - Use **oxytocin, ergometrine, carboprost** to stop bleeding.  
- **Amniotic Fluid Embolism (AFE):**  
  - Rare but fatal → Treat as **anaphylaxis + cardiogenic shock** (oxygen, fluids, vasopressors).  

---

#### **7. Neonatal Resuscitation After Anesthesia**  
- **APGAR Score (1 min & 5 min post-delivery):**  
  - **Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration** (0-10 scoring system).  
- **Risk of Respiratory Depression:**  
  - More common with **opioid-based anesthesia** (e.g., remifentanil, morphine).  
  - Naloxone can be used for opioid-induced respiratory depression in neonates.  

---

#### **8. Special Considerations in High-Risk Pregnancies**  
- **Morbid Obesity in Pregnancy:**  
  - Difficult airway management → Always have **difficult airway cart ready**.  
  - Higher risk of **hypoxia, aspiration, and failed intubation**.  
- **Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy:**  
  - Epidural anesthesia is preferred to avoid sudden BP drops.  
  - Avoid excessive fluid administration (risk of heart failure).  

---

### **Final Summary**  
- **Neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural) is preferred** over general anesthesia for labor and C-sections.  
- **Hypotension is the most common side effect** of spinal anesthesia.  
- **Airway management is challenging in pregnancy** due to edema and weight gain.  
- **Preeclampsia requires careful BP management** and seizure prevention with **magnesium sulfate**.  
- **Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal mortality** → Oxytocin is first-line treatment.  
- **Neonatal resuscitation should be anticipated**, especially if opioids or general anesthesia were used.
