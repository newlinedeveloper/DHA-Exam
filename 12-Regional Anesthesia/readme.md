## **Regional Anesthesia – Short and Important Notes**

### **1. Definition & Overview**  
Regional anesthesia involves blocking nerve impulses to a specific area of the body while maintaining consciousness. It includes **spinal, epidural, peripheral nerve blocks, and intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block).**

---

### **2. Types of Regional Anesthesia**  

#### **A. Neuraxial Anesthesia** (Spinal & Epidural)  
- **Spinal Anesthesia**:  
  - Injected into the **subarachnoid space (L3-L4 or L4-L5).**  
  - **Single-shot technique** using local anesthetics (e.g., bupivacaine, lidocaine).  
  - Used for **lower abdominal, pelvic, and lower limb surgeries.**  
  - Side effects: **Hypotension, bradycardia, post-dural puncture headache (PDPH).**  

- **Epidural Anesthesia**:  
  - Injected into the **epidural space** using a **catheter for continuous infusion.**  
  - Provides **longer duration analgesia** (e.g., labor pain, post-op pain).  
  - Can be used for **thoracic, lumbar, and sacral nerve blocks.**  
  - Side effects: **Hypotension, epidural hematoma, dural puncture.**  

---

#### **B. Peripheral Nerve Blocks**  
- **Upper Limb Blocks**:  
  - **Brachial Plexus Block**: Interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary approaches.  
  - Used for **shoulder, arm, forearm, and hand surgeries.**  

- **Lower Limb Blocks**:  
  - **Femoral Nerve Block**: For knee surgeries.  
  - **Sciatic Nerve Block**: For foot and ankle surgeries.  
  - **Popliteal Nerve Block**: For Achilles tendon repair.  

- **Truncal Blocks**:  
  - **Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block**: For abdominal surgeries.  
  - **Paravertebral Block**: For thoracic surgeries and breast surgeries.  

---

#### **C. Intravenous Regional Anesthesia (Bier Block)**  
- Used for **short procedures on the arm or forearm.**  
- **Lidocaine is injected IV** after placing a tourniquet to prevent systemic absorption.  
- **Risk:** Tourniquet pain, local anesthetic toxicity if tourniquet fails.
