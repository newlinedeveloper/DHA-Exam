# **Respiratory (Ventilation & Pulmonary Management) – Short & Important Notes**  

## **1. Anatomy & Physiology of Respiration**  
- **Conducting Zone**: Trachea → Bronchi → Bronchioles (No gas exchange).  
- **Respiratory Zone**: Terminal bronchioles → Alveolar ducts → Alveoli (Gas exchange).  
- **Alveolar Ventilation (VA)** = (Tidal Volume - Dead Space) × Respiratory Rate.  
- **Dead Space**:
  - **Anatomic** (Conducting airways, ~150 mL).  
  - **Physiologic** (Alveoli not participating in gas exchange, e.g., pulmonary embolism).  

## **2. Pulmonary Mechanics & Compliance**  
- **Lung Compliance**: The ease of lung expansion (↓ in fibrosis, ↑ in emphysema).  
- **Airway Resistance (Raw)**: Affected by tube size, bronchoconstriction, secretions.  
- **Elastic Recoil**: Needed for passive expiration (↓ in COPD).  

## **3. Oxygen Transport & Carbon Dioxide Elimination**  
- **Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve**:  
  - **Right Shift (↓ Affinity, More O₂ delivery)**: Increased CO₂, Acidosis, Hyperthermia, High 2,3-DPG.  
  - **Left Shift (↑ Affinity, Less O₂ delivery)**: Alkalosis, Hypothermia, Low CO₂, Low 2,3-DPG.  
- **Hypoxemia Causes**:  
  - V/Q Mismatch (e.g., Pulmonary embolism).  
  - Diffusion Limitation (e.g., Pulmonary fibrosis).  
  - Right-to-Left Shunt (e.g., ARDS, Pneumonia).  

## **4. Ventilation Modes & Strategies**  
- **Volume-Controlled Ventilation (VCV)**: Delivers fixed tidal volume.  
- **Pressure-Controlled Ventilation (PCV)**: Limits peak pressure, useful in ARDS.  
- **Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)**: Patient-triggered breaths, weaning mode.  
- **SIMV (Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation)**: Mix of mandatory & spontaneous breaths.  
- **PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure)**: Prevents alveolar collapse, improves oxygenation.  

## **5. Pulmonary Pathophysiology in Anesthesia**  
- **Atelectasis**: Collapse of alveoli (Common post-op, prevented with PEEP & recruitment maneuvers).  
- **ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)**:  
  - Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  
  - Low tidal volume (6 mL/kg) & high PEEP strategy.  
- **COPD & Asthma**:  
  - COPD: High compliance, low elasticity → Avoid excessive PEEP.  
  - Asthma: Bronchoconstriction → Use bronchodilators, slow RR.  
- **Pulmonary Embolism**: V/Q mismatch, sudden hypoxia → Anticoagulation, thrombolysis if severe.  

## **6. Airway Pressure & Monitoring**  
- **Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP)**: Increased in airway resistance (e.g., bronchospasm).  
- **Plateau Pressure (Pplat)**: Increased in low lung compliance (e.g., ARDS, fibrosis).  
- **Capnography (ETCO₂ Monitoring)**:  
  - Low ETCO₂: Hyperventilation, pulmonary embolism.  
  - High ETCO₂: Hypoventilation, CO₂ retention (e.g., COPD).  

## **7. Perioperative Respiratory Management**  
- **Preoxygenation**: 100% O₂ before induction prevents desaturation.  
- **Aspiration Risk Management**: Use RSI (Rapid Sequence Induction) in full stomach patients.  
- **Postoperative Pulmonary Complications**:  
  - Prevent with incentive spirometry, early mobilization, adequate pain control.  
  - Avoid excessive IV fluids (risk of pulmonary edema).

### **Mock Test Answer Key & Explanations: Respiratory (Ventilation & Pulmonary Management)**  

Here are the **correct answers** along with **detailed explanations** for each question.  

---

### **1-10: Pulmonary Physiology & Mechanics**  

1. **C) Prevent alveolar collapse**  
   - Surfactant reduces surface tension in alveoli, preventing their collapse and improving lung compliance.  

2. **A) Pulmonary embolism**  
   - A pulmonary embolism increases physiological dead space by obstructing perfusion, leading to wasted ventilation.  

3. **C) Increased 2,3-DPG**  
   - Increased 2,3-DPG reduces hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen, shifting the curve right and promoting oxygen unloading in tissues.  

4. **B) Alveolar ventilation decreases**  
   - Dead space ventilation does not participate in gas exchange, so alveolar ventilation decreases despite unchanged minute ventilation.  

5. **C) Decreased lung compliance**  
   - ARDS leads to stiff, non-compliant lungs, requiring more effort for ventilation.  

6. **C) 80-100 mmHg**  
   - Normal arterial PaO₂ at sea level is **80-100 mmHg**.  

7. **C) Emphysema**  
   - Emphysema destroys alveolar walls, increasing lung compliance and making lungs more prone to collapse.  

8. **C) Hypoventilation and air trapping**  
   - COPD patients retain CO₂ due to hypoventilation and air trapping, leading to respiratory acidosis.  

9. **C) Atelectasis**  
   - Postoperative hypoxemia is most commonly due to **atelectasis**, which results from small airway closure and poor lung expansion.  

10. **C) Ventilation-perfusion mismatch**  
    - Pulmonary embolism disrupts perfusion but maintains ventilation, leading to **V/Q mismatch** and hypoxemia.  

---

### **11-20: Ventilation Modes & Strategies**  

11. **B) Volume-controlled ventilation (VCV)**  
    - In VCV, each breath delivers a set tidal volume regardless of airway pressures.  

12. **A) Decrease inspiratory time**  
    - Increasing inspiratory flow rate **shortens inspiratory time**, allowing more time for expiration.  

13. **B) PSV (Pressure Support Ventilation)**  
    - In PSV, patients initiate breaths, and the ventilator provides pressure support to reduce work of breathing.  

14. **C) Prevent alveolar collapse**  
    - PEEP prevents alveolar collapse by maintaining positive pressure at the end of expiration.  

15. **A) Increased airway resistance (e.g., bronchospasm)**  
    - High peak inspiratory pressure with normal plateau pressure suggests **increased airway resistance**, as seen in bronchospasm or secretions.  

16. **A) Low tidal volume (6 mL/kg) and high PEEP**  
    - ARDS patients benefit from **lung-protective ventilation** (low tidal volumes and high PEEP) to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury.  

17. **A) Carotid chemoreceptors**  
    - Increased PaCO₂ stimulates **carotid chemoreceptors**, increasing respiratory drive.  

18. **C) 6-8 mL/kg**  
    - Lung-protective ventilation uses tidal volumes of **6-8 mL/kg** ideal body weight.  

19. **C) Hypovolemic shock**  
    - High PEEP can **reduce venous return**, worsening **hypovolemic shock**.  

20. **B) Carbon dioxide elimination (PaCO₂)**  
    - Increasing respiratory rate directly **lowers PaCO₂**, while oxygenation is mainly affected by FiO₂ and PEEP.
