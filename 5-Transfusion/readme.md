### **Short and Important Notes on Transfusion for DHA Anesthesia Exam**  

#### **1. Blood Components and Indications**  
- **Whole Blood**: Rarely used; indicated for massive hemorrhage with both RBC and plasma loss.  
- **Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBCs)**: Used for anemia, hemorrhage, and inadequate oxygen delivery. One unit raises hemoglobin by **1 g/dL**.  
- **Platelets**: Indicated for thrombocytopenia (<50,000/µL in surgical patients). One unit raises platelet count by **5,000-10,000/µL**.  
- **Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)**: Contains clotting factors; used in **coagulopathy**, **DIC**, and **liver disease**.  
- **Cryoprecipitate**: Rich in fibrinogen, Factor VIII, and vWF; used for **hemophilia A**, **von Willebrand disease**, and **hypofibrinogenemia**.  

#### **2. Blood Transfusion Triggers**  
- Hemoglobin < **7 g/dL** in stable patients.  
- Hemoglobin < **8 g/dL** in patients with **cardiac disease**.  
- Active bleeding with hemodynamic instability.  
- Platelets < **50,000/µL** in **surgical or bleeding patients**.  
- Platelets < **10,000/µL** in **non-bleeding, high-risk patients** (e.g., chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia).  

#### **3. Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP)**  
- Defined as **≥10 units of PRBCs** within 24 hours or **≥4 units** in 1 hour.  
- **Ratio**: **1:1:1 (PRBCs:FFP:Platelets)** for trauma cases.  
- **Complications**: Coagulopathy, acidosis, hypothermia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia.  

#### **4. Transfusion Reactions**  
| Type | Cause | Symptoms | Management |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Hemolytic Reaction** | ABO incompatibility | Fever, hypotension, flank pain, DIC | Stop transfusion, IV fluids, diuretics |
| **Febrile Non-Hemolytic** | Cytokine release from WBCs | Fever, chills | Acetaminophen, leukoreduction |
| **Allergic Reaction** | Plasma proteins | Urticaria, itching | Antihistamines, continue if mild |
| **Anaphylaxis** | IgA deficiency | Hypotension, bronchospasm | Epinephrine, steroids |
| **TRALI (Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury)** | Donor HLA antibodies | Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypoxia | Stop transfusion, oxygen, supportive care |
| **Iron Overload** | Repeated transfusions | Organ damage, arrhythmias | Chelation therapy (deferoxamine) |

#### **5. Special Considerations in Transfusion**  
- **Irradiated Blood**: Used for **immunocompromised patients** (e.g., bone marrow transplant) to prevent **GVHD**.  
- **Leukoreduced Blood**: Reduces febrile reactions, CMV transmission, and alloimmunization.  
- **Washed RBCs**: Used for **IgA-deficient patients** to prevent anaphylaxis.  

#### **6. Laboratory Monitoring in Transfusion**  
- **PT/INR, aPTT**: To assess clotting function in massive transfusions.  
- **Ionized Calcium**: Citrate in transfused blood can cause **hypocalcemia**.  
- **Potassium**: Stored blood can lead to **hyperkalemia**, especially in renal failure patients.  

#### **7. Alternatives to Blood Transfusion**  
- **Erythropoietin (EPO)**: Used in chronic anemia (e.g., CKD).  
- **IV Iron Therapy**: In iron-deficiency anemia.  
- **Tranexamic Acid (TXA)**: Antifibrinolytic, reduces bleeding in trauma and surgery.

### **Summary**
- PRBCs increase hemoglobin **by 1 g/dL per unit**.  
- **1:1:1 ratio (PRBCs:FFP:Platelets)** in **massive transfusion protocols**.  
- **Hemolytic reactions** are the most severe and caused by **ABO incompatibility**.  
- **TRALI** presents with **non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema**.  
- **Hypocalcemia** and **hyperkalemia** are common metabolic complications.  
- **Leukoreduction, irradiation, and washing** modify blood for high-risk patients.
